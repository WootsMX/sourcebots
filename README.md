# SourceBots

SourceBots is an Artificial Intelligence system for create Bots in:

* [Source SDK 2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013)
* [Alien Swarm](https://github.com/Sandern/aswscratch)

## What is the difference between a Bot and an NPC?

As its name indicates, an NPC (**non-player character**) is a character that can interact with the player but is not taken as one, so you can not perform certain actions on it, such as: view it in spectator mode, display it in the players list, etc.

Instead, a Bot is the Artificial Intelligence in charge of thinking and "inject" commands _(move the mouse, press buttons)_ that would make a human player.

Public versions of Source Engine only have an A.I. to create NPC's, SourceBots allows you to have another A.I. to create Bots.

## Alpha version!

The current system is in an **Alpha** and is not recommended to be deployed in a mod release. It is possible to encounter bugs and memory leaks.

Use the current version to **test and improve it**, among all we can achieve a stable and complete version.

You can report bugs, suggestions and improvements [here](https://github.com/WootsMX/SourceBots/issues).

## TODO

You can find all comments with the word [TODO](https://github.com/WootsMX/SourceBots/search?q=TODO&type=Code), try to solve as many as you can!

Big ones:

* Problems in navigation
* Use melee weapons
* Use doors
* Detect and fix memory leaks
* Make the code easier to work
* English comments
* Being able to use the A.I. in NPC's [(Like NextBot)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/NextBot)
* Performance Issues
* More...

## How to start

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/WootsMX/SourceBots/wiki) with everything you need to implement it in your project!

## Base Code

With SourceBots you can create your own A.I. that suits the needs of your mod. The base code has what it takes to:

* Move using the [Navigation Mesh](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Navigation_Meshes)
* Detect friends, enemies and neutral entities.
* Attack, reload, cover, chase, etc.
* Change to the best weapon according to the conditions
